# WelcomeTo
Interface for viewing "Welcome To..." deals online. Will not handle scoring - use the official app / scoring pads for that.

# Idea list

- make "all ready" more visible
- confirm deal when not all ready
- confirm new game always
- sound for new deal shows up
- sound for all players ready
- automatic deal new when all ready, 5s delay with visual indicator
- "game has ended" -> upload your score -> share them all at once with rankings
- ready up by clicking the cards you're using, save that off too
- add "biz" text to envelopes
- Players can have a "status" - usually null, "afk" is an option
- Let players claim development plans locally, even if globally already claimed 
  - track this as a game end condition
- Visually indicate a shuffle is coming
- Track temp usages, broadcast to players when the game ends
- Show card distributions
- Ask for shuffle when someone claims plan for full points
- Show build range for temp worker suits
- Players list shows which plans are claimed, and how many rejections
- easy/hard selector
- Optional time limit for deals
